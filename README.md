The lab contains two files, one is the source code while the other is the test class.

For it to work, create a project named DirectoryCrawler, the lab will crawl the entire project folder and index it. It will also index the contents of the text files.

Now you can search the index by giving a string which will be searched in the hashmap in the index.

Simply run the code.

I have tested my DirectoryCrawler function only, it returns 0 when the directory is not present and i hace checked that.
